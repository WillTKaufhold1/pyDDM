# Python DDM

## Introduction

I created this program to make Dynamic Differential Microscopy (DDM) in Python easier. It contains some specific features I wanted to have: 

1. GPU acceleration
2. Clever memory management
3. Fitting arbitrary models of particles, including multiple particles and polydispersity
4. Automated structure function fitting
